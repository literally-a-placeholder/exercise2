# Keyword Spotting Data

## Task ##
Your task is to develop a machine learning approach for spotting keywords in the provided documents.
You can test your approach on the provided training and validation dataset where you find a list of
keywords that you can find for certain at least once in each set.

## Competition ##
The results from the competition (started on 21st of May, 2019) are located in the 'results_test' directory.

Containing:
- 'results.txt': sorted list for all keywords with sorted raw euclidean distances
- 'results_norm.txt': sorted list for all keywords with sorted normalized dissimilarity measures (to account for innate differences in distances for different keywords). This is the intended output. Only use the raw distances if problems occur with further analysis.

To get the best results use the 'results_norm.txt' for precision/recall analysis of the system.

Output format as specified in the lecture:

```
Keyword1, testword_ID1, dissimilarity1, testword_ID2, dissimilarity2, ...
Keyword2, testword_ID1, dissimilarity1, testword_ID2, dissimilarity2, ...
```
Example:
```
051, 46, 6.40341144, 21, 7.62949846, 17, 9.18516724, 03, 10.47132116, […]
043, 02, 0.99152807, 22, 4.82357323, 14, 2.14435743, 42, 5.05044537, […]
[…]
```

## Run ##
Clone the project and run the following command from the root folder to install all dependencies.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Execute 'run_task.py'

Sidenotes:

- only 105 results are generated, of 107 specified keywords in keywords.txt, since the two words
'order' and 'waggons' appear each in upper and lower case, which is ignored.
- the results produced are saved once with the raw distances ('results.txt') and once with normalized values (summing to 100) in the 'resutls_norm.txt'
- the resulting plot from the evaluation is still not entierly correct (start of the line should be
at a precision value of 1 on the left side), due to some unresolved bugs

See overall precision/recall-plot 'plot_norm_results_overall.png' for the most recent evaluation.

## Install new Packages ##
Make sure to install new packages using the following commands in order to make sure that the
dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file:

```python
pip install <package> 
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Data ##
In this repository you'll find all the data necessary for your KeywordSpotting Task.

You find the following folders:


### ground-truth ###
Contains ground-truth data.

#### transcription.txt ####

Contains the transcription of all words (on a character level) of the whole dataset. The Format is
as follows:

	- XXX-YY-ZZ: XXX = Document Number, YY = Line Number, ZZ = Word Number
	- Contains the character-wise transcription of the word (letters seperated with dashes)
	- Special characters denoted with s_
		- numbers (s_x)
		- punctuation (s_pt, s_cm, ...)
		- strong s (s_s)
		- hyphen (s_mi)
		- semicolon (s_sq)
		- apostrophe (s_qt)
		- colon (s_qo)

#### locations #####

Contains bounding boxes for all words in the svg-format.

	- XXX.svg: File containing the bounding boxes for the given documents
	- **id** contains the same XXX-YY-ZZ naming as above

### images ###

Contains the original images in jpg-format.

### task ###
Contains three files:

####train.txt / valid.txt ####
Contains a splitting of the documents into a training and a validation set.


#### keywords.txt ####
Contains a list of keywords of which each will be at least **once** in the training and validation
dataset.
